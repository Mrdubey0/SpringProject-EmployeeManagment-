# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a Java-based application built using Spring, Hibernate (JPA), and MySQL. This system allows you to manage employee records, including CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for employee details like phone, email, position, and department.

## Features

- Add new employees
- Update employee details
- Find employee by ID
- Delete employee by ID
- Retrieve all employees
- Search for employees by email

## Technologies Used

- **Java 11**
- **Spring Framework** (Core, IoC, Annotations)
- **Hibernate** (JPA for ORM)
- **MySQL** (Database)
- **Maven** (For project build and dependency management)
- **Lombok** (To reduce boilerplate code)
- **JPA Entity Manager** (For persistence management)

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher installed
- MySQL installed and running
- Maven installed
- Basic knowledge of Spring Framework and Hibernate

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-management.git
   cd employee-management
Create a MySQL database for the project:

sql
 ```bash
CREATE DATABASE employee_management;
Update application.properties (or persistence.xml) file with your MySQL database configurations:

 ```bash
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_management
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
Run the application from your IDE or using Maven:


mvn spring-boot:run
Interact with the system via the console-based driver (EmployeeDriver.java) to perform CRUD operations.

Running the Application
The application is a simple command-line interface that you can run from your IDE or terminal. Follow the prompts to perform different operations:

Add an employee
Find an employee by ID
Delete an employee
Update an employee
View all employees
Search by employee email
